## Creating your IAM Account and login to SkyPortal

We will access to ICARE / SkyPortal through IAM's [login page](https://skyportal-icare.ijclab.in2p3.fr) to create your account.

First, click on `Sign in with IAM`:

Then, choose the method of your choice:
* **Slack** is reserved for GRANDMA people.
* **ORCID** is available for anyone and is **preferred**.
* **Edugain** is available for anyone.

*If you are not able to use one of these methods to authenticate, please contact us to discuss alternatives.*

### Notes on Slack registration
If you choose to create your IAM Account using Slack, you might be asked for your workspace name.
If that's the case, use `grandmagroupe` as workspace name.

### Notes on ORCID or eduGAIN registration
If you use ORCID, you can use your account as normal.

If you use eduGAIN, you need to select
your home institution: you can enter some letters from its name to filter the long list...

## Form registration

A form will be displayed: enter your `firstname`, `lastname`, `email` and `username`.
Also, you'll notice a `note` field. We request you to put your affiliation in this note, as well as other information
you may find useful. It is mandatory ! Upon submitting the form, a message will appear confirming that you applied for an account.

## Account validation

You will receive an email, asking you to validate your email, with a confirmation link.
Please click the link: accounts will not be validated until you confirmed your email.
**Your account won't be verified by an administrator until you do it.** Once it is done, wait
for your account to be validated by an administrator: once it is done you'll receive a new email
that also contains a link to set your IAM password: **just ignore it** as you will not need it
to access Icare with Slack, ORCID or eduGAIN.
